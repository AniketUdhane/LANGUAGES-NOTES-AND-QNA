1. What is NOT a way to use version control?
making changes to an image file and saving the new version to the same file

2. How might users make use of Git's version control capabilities?
A development team can use Git to evaluate version differences before prior to new changes into the production code base.
Correct

Git's strengths lie in its ability to allow multiple users to contribute to a repository, and the repo owner can easily evaluate proposed changes with Git's tools.

3. Why is Git so much more powerful than earlier version control systems?
It is fast, can handle large code bases, and is distributed.

4. What is the effect if a file in the main repository becomes corrupted?
There is no effect on users' local copies.
Correct

Because Git is distributed, the file in users' repositories will be unaffected by any changes to the file in the main repository unless users attempt to retrieve the corrupted file.
