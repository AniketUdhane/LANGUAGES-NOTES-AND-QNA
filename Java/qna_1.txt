1. How would you output the value stored in a variable named studentAge and make the next output begin on a new line?
System.out.println(studentAge);
The `println` method is a command that outputs values with a new line character added to the end.

2. What does the data type int stand for?
integer

3. How would you write code to get input from the user and store an integer value into your program?
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
studentNumber = input.nextInt();
To get an integer number from the user, use the `nextInt` method of the `System.in` class.

4. What code would you put in line 4 to output "Kayla has a GPA of 3.75" to the console?

1) public static void main(String[] args) {
2)    double studentGPA = 3.75;
3)    String studentFirstName = "Kayla";
4)    _____ }
System.out.println(studentFirstName + " has a GPA of " + studentGPA);
To concatenate strings in Java, the `+` operator is used.

5. What is the syntactically correct way to declare a variable in Java?
int numberOfPeople;
In Java, when we create variables, we have the data type followed by the variable name. Here int stands for integer meaning whole number and numberOfPeople is the name of the variable.

6. If a variable called studentFirstName contained the value Brian, then how would you reference the character n?
studentFirstName.charAt(4);
In Java, an array starts with an index of zero. So, the `n` would be at index position four.

7. _____ in real life can be represented in code.
Anything

8. We describe the types of data an object has in a Class with _____.
properties or attributes

9. A string is what kind of data type?
reference
A string is a reference data type; it is actually a collection of char data types in sequential order.

10. How would you declare a variable named studentGPA and assign it an initial value of 3.45?
double studentGPA = 3.45;
A valid declaration specifies data type, name, and optionally an initial value. A double data type is best since a GPA has a fractional part.

11. Which data type would you use to represent the number of children there are in someone's family?
integer
The number of children is represented by a whole number, which is represented by an integer data type in Java.

12. What would the following code return?
e
The charAt String instance method returns a character. Since Strings start their indexing at 0, the character at index 3 is e.

13. Which example shows the correct syntax for a while loop?
while (isOnRepeat) {
    String userInput = input.next();
    if (userInput.equals("yes")) {
        isOnRepeat = false; }
}
This is the correct example. It is important to have a trigger to exit out of a loop.

14. In the following code, which line numbers are in scope for the favoriteNumber variable?
if (inputtedNum < 100) {
int favoriteNumber = 5;
1) favoriteNumber = 10;
2) System.out.println(favoriteNumber);
} else {
3) System.out.println(favoriteNumber); }
4) inputtedNum++;

1, 2
Since the variable is declared inside the `if` statement, it is only available in lines 1 and 2 before the closing curly bracket is seen.

15. If the value of inputtedNum is 6, then what is the output of the following code?

if (inputtedNum < 5) {
    System.out.println("The sun will shine bright"); 
} else {
    System.out.println("The moon will glow bright");
}
The moon will glow bright
The value `6` would make the `if` condition false, so the code under the `else` statement would be executed.

16. Which control flow statement is represented by a diamond shape in a flowchart diagram?
if

17. How would you best describe what control flow statements do in a program?
They can cause a block of code to be executed once, multiple times, or not at all.
Control flow statements allow code to be executed in different ways besides the default sequential order.

18. How would you describe a while loop?
Check whether the condition is true; if it is true, then keep repeating until the condition is false.
A `while` loop keeps repeating a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to a true value.

19. What best describes a breakpoint?
an intentional stopping point put into a program for debugging purposes
A breakpoint allows you to stop the program at a particular line of code, and is thus a useful debugging tool.

20. Which scenario represents a logic error?
displaying output that the user guessed incorrectly, when the user's answer is spelled correctly but is capitalized

21. What is the main characteristic of a syntax error?
It causes a program to fail before it is able to run.
Source code that has a syntax error will not compile, and spelling a keyword wrong is a common cause of this.

22. When is an appropriate time to use a breakpoint?
to determine whether a block of code is not executing as it should
A breakpoint is a useful tool to examine whether a piece of code is being executed or skipped.
