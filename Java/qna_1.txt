1. How would you output the value stored in a variable named studentAge and make the next output begin on a new line?
System.out.println(studentAge);
The `println` method is a command that outputs values with a new line character added to the end.

2. What does the data type int stand for?
integer

3. How would you write code to get input from the user and store an integer value into your program?
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
studentNumber = input.nextInt();
To get an integer number from the user, use the `nextInt` method of the `System.in` class.

4. What code would you put in line 4 to output "Kayla has a GPA of 3.75" to the console?

1) public static void main(String[] args) {
2)    double studentGPA = 3.75;
3)    String studentFirstName = "Kayla";
4)    _____ }
System.out.println(studentFirstName + " has a GPA of " + studentGPA);
To concatenate strings in Java, the `+` operator is used.

5. What is the syntactically correct way to declare a variable in Java?
int numberOfPeople;
In Java, when we create variables, we have the data type followed by the variable name. Here int stands for integer meaning whole number and numberOfPeople is the name of the variable.

6. If a variable called studentFirstName contained the value Brian, then how would you reference the character n?
studentFirstName.charAt(4);
In Java, an array starts with an index of zero. So, the `n` would be at index position four.

7. _____ in real life can be represented in code.

10. How would you declare a variable named studentGPA and assign it an initial value of 3.45?
double studentGPA = 3.45;
A valid declaration specifies data type, name, and optionally an initial value. A double data type is best since a GPA has a fractional part.

11. Which data type would you use to represent the number of children there are in someone's family?
integer
The number of children is represented by a whole number, which is represented by an integer data type in Java.
